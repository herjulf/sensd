The last report from can re retrieved form the sensd file tree. Which works as 
a "RESTful" caching server. Compare a CoAP HTTP proxy.

An URI example. Three sensors in total. We "GET" the temperature (T) from 
from the sensors with ID == WSN1-GW1/28be51ce0200003

Measurement time is in the URI. For a example wget (GNU 1.13.4) by default, when
a file is downloaded, it's timestamps are set to match those from the remote
